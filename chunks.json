The\npromise is to usher in an AI-enabled instructional environment\nand make serendipitous learning more enjoyable for students.However, the complicated setup of many modern LMSs in\nhigher education, increasing student numbers, the size and\nvariety of educational material, information overload, and the\nproblems of recruiting competent teachers or lecturers present\nfundamental chal"

A discussionon the pedagogical justiﬁcation for the development of\nMoodleBot was followed by the architectural design and the\nintegration of MoodleBot into the Moodle LMS of RWTHAachen University.

The capacity of a\nlanguage model to anticipate a specific textual sequence\nis measured by its perplexity, which is frequently used to\nevaluate the model-generated text’s plausibility and fluency.\nIt is well known that high-quality texts must be entered into\nan RAG corpus in order to meet security and efficiency\nstandards. In particular, we think that a low-quality text is\nmore likely to be toxic; the more unclear a text is, the more\nlikely it is to be hazardous.

The following\nexample in the Figure 10illustrates this situation with a\nspecific example. The increased complexity of the models\nafter the training phase can lead to longer, more detailed\nresponses. However, this complexity can also introduce\nthe problem of hallucination, where the model generates\ninformation that is not present in the input data.\nTo systematically assess the efficacy of various language\nmodel training techniques, we conducted a comparative anal-\nysis of model performances employing three distinct strate-\ngies: fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and\na hybrid approach that combines both, specifically target-\ning the Stanford Questi"

The DuCo-Net method\ncomprises two contrastive learning models: backbone and\naugmented networks.
